# ✅ GOOGLE DRIVE BACKUP - FIXED!

## 🎯 You Were Right!

**Problem:** Saving database backups IN the database = STUPID! 😅
**Solution:** Save to Google Drive = SMART! 🧠

---

## 🚀 What I Did

### 1. Created Google Drive Integration
- **File:** `src/lib/google-drive-backup.ts`
- Uploads backups to your Google Drive
- Lists backups from Drive
- Downloads from Drive
- Deletes from Drive

### 2. Updated User Model
- **File:** `src/models/User.ts`
- Added: `googleAccessToken` and `googleRefreshToken`
- Stores OAuth tokens for Drive API access

### 3. Updated NextAuth
- **File:** `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- Saves OAuth tokens when you sign in with Google
- Tokens used to access your Drive

### 4. Updated All Backup Routes
- ✅ `backup/route.ts` - Uploads to Drive
- ✅ `backups/route.ts` - Lists from Drive
- ✅ `backups/[id]/route.ts` - Downloads from Drive
- ✅ `restore/route.ts` - Restores from Drive

## 📦 Installation Required

**Run this command:**
```powershell
npm install googleapis
```

This installs the Google Drive API client.

## 📁 Where Backups Go

```
Your Google Drive
└── TsvWeb Backups/
    ├── tsvweb-backup-database-1760859000.json
    ├── tsvweb-backup-database-1760859100.json
    └── ...
```

**NOT in your database!** In Google Drive where backups belong! ✅

## 🎨 How It Works
