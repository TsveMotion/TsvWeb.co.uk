## 🚀 Workflow

### Sending a Contract for Signature

1. **Admin uploads contract PDF** via "Files" button
2. **Admin clicks "Send for E-Signature"** in Files modal
3. System:
   - Creates an Agreement record with contract details
   - Links the uploaded PDF to the agreement
   - Sends email to client with unique signing link
   - Updates contract status to 'sent' with timestamp
   - Copies link to clipboard
4. **Client receives email** with "View & Sign Agreement" button
5. **Client opens link** → sees PDF with zoom/pagination
6. **Client types name** and checks acceptance box
7. **Client submits** → signature recorded with full audit trail
8. **Both parties receive confirmation email** with signature details

### Data Flow

```
Contract (Admin) 
  → Upload PDF file
  → Send for E-Signature
    → Create Agreement (with pdfPath)
    → Send Email (with unique token link)
    → Update Contract (status='sent', sentAt=now)
  
Agreement (Client)
  → Open link /agreements/[token]
  → View PDF
  → Type name + accept terms
  → Submit
    → Record signature (name, IP, UA, timestamp)
    → Update status to 'signed'
    → Send confirmation emails
```

## 📧 Email Configuration

**Required ENV variables** (fix SMTP timeout errors):
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password  # Use App Password if Gmail
SMTP_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

**Gmail Setup**:
1. Enable 2FA on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use that password in `SMTP_PASS`
4. Restart dev server after updating .env
