# ✅ Support Tickets Management & Currency Formatting Fixed

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Support Ticket Management ✅

Added full ticket management capabilities to the Support Tickets page.

**New Features:**

#### Change Ticket Status
- **Open** - Mark ticket as open (green button)
- **In Progress** - Mark ticket as being worked on (yellow button)
- **Resolved** - Mark ticket as resolved (blue button)
- **Closed** - Mark ticket as closed (gray button)

**UI:**
- Buttons appear in the ticket detail modal
- Current status button is disabled (grayed out)
- Color-coded buttons for easy identification
- Status updates in real-time

#### Delete Tickets
- **Delete Button** - Red button with 🗑️ icon
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Permanently removes ticket from database
- Cannot be undone

**Location:**
- All buttons appear in the ticket detail modal
- Under "Change Status" and "Quick Actions" sections

---

### 2. Currency Formatting Fixed ✅

Fixed the issue where currency symbols were showing as HTML entities (`&pound;` instead of `£`).

**Problem:**
- Currency was displaying as `&pound;0.00` instead of `£0.00`
- HTML entities not being decoded

**Solution:**
- Added `decodeHtmlEntity()` helper function
- Decodes HTML entities like `&pound;`, `&euro;`, `&yen;`, etc.
- Applied to all revenue displays

**Fixed Locations:**
- Total Revenue display
- Last 30 Days Revenue display
- All currency symbols now show correctly

}
```

**Response:**

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Ticket status updated",
  "ticket": { ... }
}
```

#### DELETE `/api/wordpress/support/[id]`
- Deletes ticket permanently
- Requires admin/editor role
