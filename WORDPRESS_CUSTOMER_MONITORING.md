✅ **JWT Authentication:** Customer endpoints use JWT tokens
✅ **Admin Authorization:** Binding requires admin/editor role
✅ **Database Indexing:** customerId field indexed for fast queries
✅ **Input Validation:** Customer ID validated before binding

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Admin Binding

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to admin WordPress sites
http://localhost:3000/admin/wordpress-sites

# Click "Bind" on a site
# Select a customer
# Click "Bind Customer"
# Verify green badge appears
```

### 2. Test Customer View

```bash
# Login as customer
http://localhost:3000/customer/login

# Navigate to dashboard
http://localhost:3000/customer/dashboard

# Scroll to "Your WordPress Sites"
# Verify site appears with data
```

### 3. Test Unbinding

```bash
# Go back to admin WordPress sites
# Click "Unbind" on bound site
# Confirm action
# Verify green badge disappears

# Go to customer dashboard
# Verify site no longer appears
```

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: MuscleMatrix.uk
1. Admin binds MuscleMatrix.uk site to customer "John Doe"
2. John logs into customer portal
3. John sees MuscleMatrix.uk with all stats
4. John can monitor his site health, posts, plugins

### Use Case 2: Multiple Sites
1. Admin binds 3 sites to customer "Jane Smith"
2. Jane logs in and sees all 3 sites in grid

### Use Case 3: Reassignment
1. Site initially bound to Customer A
2. Admin clicks "Change" button
