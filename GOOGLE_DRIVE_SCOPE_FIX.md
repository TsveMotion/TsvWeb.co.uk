# âœ… Google Drive Scope - FIXED!

## Problem
Error: "No access, refresh token, API key or refresh handler callback is set"

## Root Cause
The Google OAuth wasn't requesting **Google Drive API access**. It only had basic profile scopes.

## Solution
Added Google Drive scope to OAuth configuration:

```typescript
scope: "openid email profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file"
```

## What This Scope Does
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` - Allows creating and accessing files created by this app in Google Drive

## Next Steps

### 1. Sign Out & Sign In Again
You need to **re-authenticate** to get the Drive scope:

1. **Sign out** of your account
2. **Sign in with Google** again
3. Google will ask for **Drive permissions**
4. **Accept** the new permissions

### 2. Test Backup to Drive
After re-authenticating:
1. Go to Settings
2. Click **"Backup to Drive"**
3. Should work now! âœ…

## Why Re-Auth is Needed
- Your current tokens don't have Drive access
- Need to sign in again to get new tokens with Drive scope
- This is a one-time thing

## Summary
âœ… Added Drive scope to OAuth
ðŸ”„ Need to sign out and sign in again
âœ… Then backups will go to Google Drive!
