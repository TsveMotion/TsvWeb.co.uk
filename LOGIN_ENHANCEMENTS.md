# Login Page Enhancements - TsvWeb

## Overview
Enhanced the customer login page with modern UX features and fixed API polling performance issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Login Page UI/UX Improvements (`/customer/login`)

#### ✅ Floating Labels
- Implemented modern floating label design for email/username and password fields
- Labels animate smoothly when field is focused or has content
- Uses CSS `peer` utility for pure CSS animations
- Maintains accessibility with proper label associations

#### ✅ Enhanced Password Field
- **Show/Hide Toggle**: Eye icon button to toggle password visibility
- **Improved Autocomplete**: Added `autocomplete="current-password"` for better browser integration
- **Accessibility**: Added `aria-label` for screen readers

#### ✅ Email/Username Field
- **Enhanced Autocomplete**: Added `autocomplete="email username"` for better autofill support
- **Floating Label**: Clean, minimal design that moves up when focused

#### ✅ Remember Me Checkbox
- Added "Remember me" checkbox option
- Integrated into form state management
- Positioned alongside "Forgot password?" link

#### ✅ Forgot Password Link
- Added "Forgot password?" link in login form
- Links to `/customer/forgot-password` page
- Styled to match brand colors (royal-blue)

### 2. Forgot Password Flow (Customers & Admins)

#### Pages:
- `/customer/forgot-password` - Customer password reset page
- `/admin/forgot-password` - Admin password reset page (already existed, now updated)

#### Unified API Endpoint: `/api/customer/auth/forgot-password`
- **POST** endpoint for password reset requests
- **Works for both customers AND admins** (role: customer, admin, editor)
- Generates secure reset token (32 bytes, SHA-256 hashed)
- Token expires after 1 hour
- Sends professional HTML email with reset link via **Resend**
- **Smart routing**: Sends customers to `/customer/reset-password`, admins to `/admin/reset-password`
- **Security**: Does NOT send email if user doesn't exist (prevents enumeration)
- Always returns success message to prevent email enumeration attacks
- Email template customizes based on user role (customer vs admin)

#### Email Template Features:
- Professional gradient header (blue to purple)
- Clear call-to-action button
- Fallback text link for email clients
- Expiry warning (1 hour)
- Company branding and footer

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### Fixed: Uptime Kuma API Polling
**File**: `src/app/customer/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Issue**: API was being polled every 30 seconds, causing excessive server load
```
 GET /api/customer/uptime?type=monitors 200 in 343ms
 GET /api/customer/uptime?type=stats 200 in 436ms
```

**Solution**: Increased polling interval from 30s to 60s
- Reduced API calls by 50%
- Maintains real-time monitoring feel
- Significantly reduces server load
- Better for production scalability

## Technical Details

### Form State Management
```typescript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  username: '',
  password: '',
  rememberMe: false  // NEW
})
```

### Floating Label CSS Pattern
```tsx
<input
  placeholder=" "  // Required for CSS peer selector
  className="peer ... placeholder-transparent"
/>
<label className="peer-placeholder-shown:top-3 peer-focus:-top-2.5">
  Label Text
</label>
```

### Database Schema Updates
Customer users in `users` collection now support:
- `resetPasswordToken`: SHA-256 hashed token
- `resetPasswordExpires`: Date object (1 hour from generation)
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp tracking

## Environment Variables Required

For forgot password functionality to work, ensure these are set in `.env.local`:

```env
# Resend Email Configuration (for password reset emails)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=TsvWeb <hello@mail.tsvweb.com>

# Application URL
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or production URL
```

**Note**: Already configured in your `.env.local` ✅

## Password Reset Pages (Completed)

### Customer Reset Password: `/customer/reset-password`
- ✅ Accepts token from URL query parameter
- ✅ Validates token before showing form
- ✅ Floating labels for password fields
- ✅ Password strength validation (min 8 characters)
- ✅ Show/hide password toggles
- ✅ Success state with auto-redirect to login
- ✅ Error handling for invalid/expired tokens
- ✅ Works WITHOUT requiring login

### Admin Reset Password: `/admin/reset-password`
- ✅ Already existed, now updated to use unified API
- ✅ Works WITHOUT requiring login
- ✅ Uses same backend as customer reset

### Remember Me Implementation
Currently the checkbox is captured but not used. To implement:
- Extend JWT token expiry when checked (7 days → 30 days)
- Update cookie maxAge accordingly
- Store preference in localStorage

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Login page displays correctly
- [x] Floating labels animate properly
- [x] Password show/hide toggle works
- [x] Remember me checkbox toggles
- [x] Forgot password link navigates correctly
- [x] Forgot password page loads (customer & admin)
- [x] Email validation works
- [ ] Password reset email sends (requires Resend API key - already configured ✅)
- [x] Reset password pages load (customer & admin)
- [x] Token validation works
- [x] Password reset works for customers
- [x] Password reset works for admins
- [x] All pages work WITHOUT requiring login
- [x] Uptime API polling reduced to 60s
- [x] Dark mode works on all new pages

## Browser Compatibility

All features use standard HTML5 and CSS3:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**: Reset tokens are hashed with SHA-256 before storage
2. **Email Enumeration Prevention**: Always returns success message
3. **Token Expiry**: 1-hour expiration prevents token reuse
4. **HTTPS Required**: Secure cookies in production
5. **Password Validation**: Existing bcrypt hashing maintained

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: 50% reduction in API calls (uptime polling)
- **Minimal**: Floating labels use CSS only (no JS overhead)
- **Negligible**: Forgot password flow only triggered on demand
