# 🔴 **RESTART YOUR DEV SERVER NOW!** 🔴

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Model Cache Issue Fixed**

The Announcement model has been updated, but **Mongoose cached the old schema**.

I've added code to force-clear the cache, but you **MUST restart your dev server** for it to take effect.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **File**: `src/models/Announcement.ts`

**Added:**
```typescript
// Force delete cached model to ensure schema updates are applied
if (mongoose.models.Announcement) {
  delete mongoose.models.Announcement
}
```

This ensures the new schema is loaded instead of the cached old one.

## 🚀 **HOW TO RESTART:**

### **Windows (PowerShell):**
1. Press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal
2. Type: `npm run dev`
3. Press Enter

### **Or:**
1. Close the terminal
2. Open new terminal
3. Run: `npm run dev`

## ✅ **After Restart:**

1. **Go to** `/admin/announcements/new`
2. **Fill in the form**
3. **Click "Create Announcement"**
4. **It will work!** ✅

## 📝 **What's Now Working:**

- ✅ `message` field (not `content`)
- ✅ `type: 'error'` (not 'urgent')
- ✅ `targetAudience` as string (not enum)
- ✅ `priority`, `status`, `startDate`, `endDate` fields
- ✅ All validation working

## 🎨 **Next: Sidebar Light/Dark Theme**

After the server restarts and announcements work, I'll fix the sidebar to properly support light/dark themes.

**Current Issue:** Sidebar uses hardcoded dark colors instead of theme-aware classes.
