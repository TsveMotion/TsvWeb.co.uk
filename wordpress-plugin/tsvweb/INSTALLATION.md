## FAQ

**Q: Does this plugin slow down my site?**  
A: No. Stats sync happens in the background every 30 seconds using WordPress cron. Product optimization is on-demand only.

**Q: How much does AI optimization cost?**  
A: Approximately $0.045 per 1,000 tokens. A typical product optimization uses 500-1,000 tokens (~$0.02-$0.05 per product).

**Q: Can I optimize products that were already optimized?**  
A: Yes. You can re-optimize products at any time. The plugin tracks the last optimization date.

**Q: What happens if I disable the optimizer?**  
A: All optimization features are hidden from users. Previously optimized products remain unchanged. Usage statistics are preserved.

**Q: Can I use this without WooCommerce?**  
A: Yes! The monitoring features work on any WordPress site. Product optimizer requires WooCommerce.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Yes. All API communication uses SSL. API keys are stored securely. No sensitive data is logged.
