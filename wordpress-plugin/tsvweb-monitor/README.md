## User Guide

### For Clients
1. **TsvWeb Control**: Main dashboard showing website status, payment info, and support form
2. **Dashboard Widget**: Quick status overview on WordPress dashboard
3. **Support Requests**: Submit support tickets directly from WordPress admin

### For TsvWeb Staff (Administrators)
1. **Settings**: Configure API key and view sync status
2. **Admin Tools**: Force sync, clear cache, view system information
3. **Remote Management**: Use REST API endpoints for remote administration

## REST API Endpoints

All endpoints require API key authentication via `X-API-Key` header or `api_key` parameter.

### Create Admin User
```
POST /wp-json/tsvweb/v1/create-admin
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: your-api-key

{
  "username": "newadmin",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "secure-password"
}
```

### Reset Password
```
POST /wp-json/tsvweb/v1/reset-password
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: your-api-key

{
  "username": "existinguser",
  "new_password": "new-secure-password"
}
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Monitoring
- Stats sync every 30 seconds via WordPress cron
- Client verification cached for 1 hour
- Payment status cached for 6 hours
- All data sent securely via HTTPS

### Data Collection
The plugin collects comprehensive site statistics including:
- Site configuration and versions
- Content counts (posts, pages, media)
- User information and roles
- Plugin and theme details
- WooCommerce data (if applicable)
- Server resources and limits

### Branding
- Replaces WordPress logo with TsvWeb branding
- Custom login page logo
- Branded admin bar
- Professional client-facing interface

## Privacy & Security

- **Secure Authentication**: API key-based authentication for all requests
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications use secure HTTPS
- **No Sensitive Data**: Passwords and payment details are never transmitted
- **Cached Verification**: Reduces API calls and improves performance
- **Nonce Protection**: All forms use WordPress nonces for CSRF protection
- **Capability Checks**: Admin tools restricted to administrators only

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Syncing
1. Check API key is configured correctly
2. Verify cron is running: `wp cron event list`
3. Check error logs for "TsvWeb Monitor" entries
4. Use "Force Sync" in Admin Tools

### Verification Failed
1. Confirm API key is valid
2. Clear cache in Admin Tools
3. Contact TsvWeb support

### Support Form Not Working
1. Verify API key is configured
2. Check internet connectivity
3. Try again or email support@tsvweb.co.uk directly
