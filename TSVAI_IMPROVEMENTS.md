## 🔗 Clickable Links Functionality

### **What Was Added:**

#### **1. Automatic Link Detection**
The AI now automatically converts these into clickable links:

**Service Pages:**
- `/services` → Clickable link
- `/services/web-design` → Clickable link
- `/services/web-development` → Clickable link
- `/services/seo` → Clickable link
- `/services/ecommerce` → Clickable link

**Other Pages:**
- `/portfolio` → Clickable link
- `/contact` → Clickable link
- `/blog` → Clickable link

**Phone Numbers:**
- `+44 7444 358808` → WhatsApp link (opens WhatsApp)

**Pricing:**
- `£30/month` → Highlighted in blue/bold
- `£200/month` → Highlighted in blue/bold

#### **2. Link Styling:**
```css
/* Links */
text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400  /* Blue in light, lighter blue in dark */
hover:underline                    /* Underline on hover */
font-medium                        /* Slightly bold */

/* Phone/WhatsApp */
text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 /* Green for WhatsApp */

/* Pricing */
font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 /* Bold and blue */
```

#### **3. Link Behavior:**
- ✅ Internal links (`/services`) navigate within app
- ✅ External links (WhatsApp) open in new tab
- ✅ Chat closes automatically after navigation
- ✅ Smooth transitions
