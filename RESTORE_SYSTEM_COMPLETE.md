}

// ... restore all collections ...

// CRITICAL: Restore current user's data to preserve Google account
if (currentUserData && currentUserEmail) {
  const User = mongoose.connection.db.collection('users');
  const restoredUser = await User.findOne({ email: currentUserEmail.toLowerCase() });
  
  if (restoredUser) {
    // Update with current Google account info
    await User.updateOne(
      { email: currentUserEmail.toLowerCase() },
      { 
        $set: { 
          googleId: currentUserData.googleId,
          googleEmail: currentUserData.googleEmail,
        } 
      }
