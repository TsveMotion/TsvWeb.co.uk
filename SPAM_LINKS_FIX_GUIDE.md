# üö® SPAM LINKS ATTACK - COMPLETE FIX GUIDE

## **PROBLEM:**
You have **3,400+ spam backlinks** pointing to fake gambling pages on your domain:
- `https://tsvweb.com/news/jackpot-cepat-mahjong-ways.html`
- `https://tsvweb.com/news/strategi-mahjong-wins-cuan.html`
- `https://tsvweb.com/news/tips-jackpot-ways2-pengganda.html`
- etc.

**These pages DON'T EXIST on your site** - this is a **Negative SEO attack**.

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION: 5-STEP FIX**

### **Step 1: Disavow Toxic Links in Google Search Console**

1. **Go to:** https://search.google.com/search-console/disavow-links
2. **Select property:** `https://tsvweb.com`
3. **Upload file:** `disavow-spam-links.txt` (I created this for you)
4. **Click:** "Submit"

**What this does:** Tells Google to ignore these spam links when ranking your site.

---

### **Step 2: Add 410 Gone Status for Spam URLs**

Create a middleware to return `410 Gone` for these fake URLs:

**File:** `src/middleware.ts`

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const url = request.nextUrl.pathname
  
  // Block spam gambling URLs with 410 Gone
  const spamPatterns = [
    '/news/jackpot',
    '/news/mahjong',
    '/news/scatter',
    '/news/strategi',
    '/news/tips-jackpot',
    '/news/trik-scatter',
    '/news/pengganda',
    '/news/ways2',
    '/news/cuan',
    '/news/gacor',
    '/news/bocor'
  ]
  
  // Check if URL matches any spam pattern
  if (spamPatterns.some(pattern => url.includes(pattern))) {
    return new NextResponse(null, {
      status: 410,
      statusText: 'Gone - This page never existed'
    })
  }
  
  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/news/:path*'
}
```

**Why 410 instead of 404?**
- `410 Gone` tells Google "this page NEVER existed and NEVER will"
- Google removes it from index faster
- Better for negative SEO attacks

### **Step 3: Block in robots.txt**

Add to your `public/robots.txt`:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /news/jackpot*
Disallow: /news/mahjong*
Disallow: /news/scatter*
Disallow: /news/strategi*
Disallow: /news/tips-jackpot*
Disallow: /news/trik-scatter*
Disallow: /news/pengganda*
Disallow: /news/ways2*
Disallow: /news/cuan*
Disallow: /news/gacor*
Disallow: /news/bocor*
```

---

### **Step 4: Report to Google (Optional but Recommended)**

1. **Go to:** https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/spamreport
2. **Report:** Negative SEO attack
3. **Provide:** List of spam URLs and domains

---

### **Step 5: Monitor and Track**

**In Google Search Console:**
1. Go to **Coverage** report
2. Check for these spam URLs
3. They should disappear in 2-4 weeks

**In Ahrefs:**
1. Check backlinks weekly
2. Export new spam domains
3. Add to disavow file if needed

---

## üìä **WHAT TO EXPECT:**

### **Week 1-2:**
- Google processes disavow file
- Spam links start being ignored
- No immediate ranking change

### **Week 3-4:**
- Spam URLs removed from index
- Domain authority stabilizes
- Rankings may improve

### **Month 2-3:**
- Full recovery
- Clean backlink profile
- Better rankings

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **PREVENT FUTURE ATTACKS:**

### **1. Monitor Backlinks Weekly**
- Use Ahrefs or Google Search Console
- Set up email alerts for new backlinks
- Check for spam patterns

### **2. Keep Disavow File Updated**
- Add new spam domains immediately
- Re-submit to Google monthly
- Keep a backup

### **3. Use Security Headers**
Add to `next.config.js`:

```javascript
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/:path*',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
          value: 'nosniff'
        },
        {
          key: 'X-Frame-Options',
          value: 'DENY'
        },
        {
          key: 'Referrer-Policy',
          value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## üîç **CHECK IF IT'S WORKING:**

### **Test 410 Response:**
```bash
curl -I https://tsvweb.com/news/jackpot-cepat-mahjong-ways.html
```

Should return:
```
HTTP/2 410
```

### **Check Google Index:**
```
site:tsvweb.com/news/jackpot
```

Should return: **No results** (after 2-4 weeks)

---

## üìù **IMPORTANT NOTES:**

1. **These are NOT your pages** - Don't create them or redirect them
2. **410 is better than 404** - Tells Google they never existed
3. **Disavow is safe** - Only affects these specific spam links
4. **Be patient** - Takes 2-4 weeks to see results
5. **Monitor regularly** - Attacks can happen again

---

## üéØ **ACTION CHECKLIST:**

- [ ] Upload `disavow-spam-links.txt` to Google Search Console
- [ ] Create `src/middleware.ts` with 410 responses
- [ ] Update `public/robots.txt` with spam patterns
