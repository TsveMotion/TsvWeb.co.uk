# Soft 404 and Theme Fixes - October 18, 2025

## Summary
Fixed three critical issues:
1. ✅ Changed default theme from 'system' to 'light'
2. ✅ Fixed soft 404 errors on portfolio pages
3. ✅ Updated sitemap.xml with all services and proper metadata

---

## 1. Default Theme Changed to Light

**File Modified:** `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Change:**
- Changed `defaultTheme="system"` to `defaultTheme="light"`
- This ensures all pages load with light theme by default instead of detecting system preferences

**Impact:**
- Users will now see the light theme by default when visiting the site
- Dark mode is still available via the theme toggle

---

## 2. Fixed Soft 404 Errors on Portfolio Pages

### Problem
Portfolio pages were returning error messages in HTML (showing "Failed to fetch portfolio item: 499") which Google interpreted as soft 404 errors. The pages were client-side rendered, causing:
- Error messages to appear in the initial HTML
- No proper HTTP 404 status codes
- Google Search Console flagging them as "Soft 404"

### Solution

#### A. Converted Portfolio Page to Server-Side Rendering
**File Modified:** `src/app/portfolio/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
1. Removed `'use client'` directive
2. Changed from client-side data fetching to server-side
3. Added `generateStaticParams()` to pre-render all portfolio pages at build time
4. Used Next.js `notFound()` function for proper 404 handling
5. Moved interactive gallery to separate client component

**Benefits:**
- Proper HTTP 404 status codes for non-existent pages
- Pre-rendered pages for better SEO and performance
- No error messages in initial HTML
- Faster page loads with static generation

#### B. Created Client Component for Gallery
**File Created:** `src/components/portfolio/portfolio-gallery.tsx`

- Handles image gallery interactivity (clicking thumbnails)
- Keeps the main page as server component
- Maintains smooth user experience

#### C. Added Custom 404 Page
**File Created:** `src/app/portfolio/[slug]/not-found.tsx`

- Professional 404 page for missing portfolio items
- Includes navigation back to portfolio and homepage
- Properly styled with brand colors

## 3. Updated Sitemap.xml

**File Modified:** `public/sitemap.xml`

### Changes Made:

#### Services Section
- ✅ Added missing service pages: `/services/booking` and `/services/portfolio`
- ✅ Removed non-existent page: `/services/hosting`
- ✅ Added proper `<priority>` tags (0.9 for main services, 0.8 for sub-pages)
- ✅ Added `<changefreq>` tags (weekly for main, monthly for sub-pages)
- ✅ Updated all `<lastmod>` dates to 2025-10-18

#### Portfolio Section
- ✅ Updated all portfolio item dates to 2025-10-18
- ✅ Added `<priority>0.7</priority>` to all portfolio items
- ✅ Added `<changefreq>monthly</changefreq>` to all portfolio items

### Complete Services List in Sitemap:
1. `/services` (main page)
2. `/services/web-design`
3. `/services/web-development`
4. `/services/ecommerce`
5. `/services/seo`
6. `/services/booking`
7. `/services/portfolio`

## Google Search Console Actions

### Immediate Actions:

   - Request indexing for each portfolio page

2. **Submit Updated Sitemap:**
   - Go to Sitemaps section
   - Remove old sitemap if present
   - Submit: https://tsvweb.co.uk/sitemap.xml

3. **Monitor for 7-14 Days:**
   - Check URL Inspection results
   - Verify "Soft 404" errors are resolved
   - Confirm pages are indexed

### Expected Results:
- Portfolio pages should show "URL is on Google" status
- No more "Soft 404" errors
- Proper indexing of all service pages
- Improved crawl efficiency

## Technical Details

### Why Soft 404 Happened:
1. Client-side rendering showed error messages in initial HTML
2. Pages returned HTTP 200 status with error content
3. Google couldn't distinguish between real content and errors
4. No proper 404 status code for missing items

### How We Fixed It:
1. Server-side rendering ensures proper HTTP status codes
2. `notFound()` function returns HTTP 404 for missing pages
3. `generateStaticParams()` pre-renders valid pages
4. Custom 404 page provides better UX

### Performance Benefits:
- Static generation = faster page loads
- Pre-rendered HTML = better SEO
- Reduced client-side JavaScript
- Improved Core Web Vitals
